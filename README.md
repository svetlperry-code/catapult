# 3D Printed Catapult

This project is a simple, fun catapult you can build with 3D printed parts and common hardware. Perfect for learning about physics, engineering, and basic mechanical assembly.

## Printing & Assembly Instructions

### 1. 3D Printing
- Download and print the catapult parts using PLA or ABS.
- Recommended print settings: 20% infill, no supports needed.

### 2. Gather Hardware
- Get all items listed in [bom.csv](./bom.csv).

### 3. Assembly
- Attach the plastic spoon to the 3D printed arm.
- Use M3 screws and nuts to secure the frame.
- Loop the rubber band around the launch arm and frame.
- Make sure everything is tightly fastened and safe.

### 4. Testing
- Place a soft object (like a pom-pom) in the spoon.
- Pull back, release, and watch it fly!

## Safety
- Only use soft projectiles.
- Clear your launch area before firing.
