## Printing & Assembly Instructions

### 1. 3D Printing
- Download and print the catapult parts using PLA or ABS.
- Recommended print settings: 20% infill, no supports needed.
.

### 3. Assembly
- Attach the plastic spoon to the 3D printed arm.
- Use M3 screws and nuts to secure the frame.
- Loop the rubber band around the launch arm and frame.
- Make sure everything is tightly fastened and safe.

### 4. Testing
- Place a soft object (like a pom-pom) in the spoon.
